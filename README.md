## My process

  ### Built with

  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - CSS custom properties
  - Mobile-first workflow

  ### What I learned

  - Actually not much I alread have a lot of experience with HTML and CSS
  - But I did learn how to create better responsive websited and how I structure my CSS better 

  ### Useful resources

  - https://www.w3schools.com - This is my absolute lifesaver for anything really if I forgot a name for a style I find myself there 9/10 times  

  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions - Always the best place for your specific problems, something you can only describe. Just know someone else already had rhe same question and you can profit from that XD

  ### AI Collaboration

  - I used ChatGTP to find out the basics of how to make websites more responsive. Stuff like the best wrapper, what units to use where. 
  - It worked really well, because Chat gave me all the necessary info and I didnt even have to dig deeper.
